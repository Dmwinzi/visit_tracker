##  Key Architectural Choices

## Clean Architecture
Organized into layers:
- data 
  Contains models and Supabase API integration (via `dio`) for fetching/storing visit data.

- domain
  Contains core business logic â€” entities and, eventually, use cases.

- presentation
  Contains UI components (screens/widgets), state management, and navigation (`router/` folder).
